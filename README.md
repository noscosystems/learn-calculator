Resources
---------

The challenge itself is meant to be vague with little help or documentation. This is like real projects where solutions to problems have to be found using any resource available.

Here are a couple of websites to read, the documentation for most things are difficult to read - but sometimes those are the only help available.

- **Composer**:
  - [Documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/).
  - [Primer](http://daylerees.com/composer-primer) and [Package Management](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/easy-package-management-with-composer--net-25530) articles.
- **PSR**, PHP standards:
  - [What is PSR?](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/psr-huh--net-29314).
  - Documentation for [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).
- **PHP**:
  - [Interfaces Documentation](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php).
  - Namespaces [Documentation](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php) and [Explaination article](http://daylerees.com/php-namespaces-explained).

And, of course, the most useful website you will ever need... [Google](http://ww.google.com).
